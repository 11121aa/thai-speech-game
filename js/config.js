  //         and piece of RPG gear is already owned, and the shop link
  //         never appears. Coins still pile up from play; they just do
  //         not gate anything.
  // false = the old paid-unlock build. Kept working, and kept readable
  //         at every site below, because turning buying back on should
  //         be one line rather than an archaeology project.
  //
  // Everything that reads it (each is commented FREE_MODE at its site):
  //   js/auth.js            -- hides the shop link in the nav
  //   shop.html             -- shows "everything is free" instead of the shop
  //   game.html             -- treats the whole upgrade catalog as owned
  //   js/game-dressup.js    -- treats every cosmetic as owned
  //   js/game-rpg.js        -- equips the best weapon/armor/skill

// Convenience reader -- config.js loads before everything else on every
// page, but this stays defensive so a page that somehow loads a script
// out of order fails closed (shop on) rather than throwing.
